# News_API_Client
Toy app for practicing Android development. News_API_Client is an example app that uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to display a list of recent news articles.
Also allows the user to save/remove their favorite artices, and to view the article's site in a web viewer.

## Motivation
Practice the use of the following design patterns / technologies

- MVVM Architecture
- Clean Architecture
  - Uncoupled DATA, DOMAIN, and PRESENTATION layers 
- Dependency Injection w/ Dagger + Hilt
- Retrofit
- Room
- Coroutines
- Data Binding

## Screenshots
Presentation design was not the focus of the app therefore the interface is fleshed out just enough to test the main functionality.
